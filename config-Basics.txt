# Backup main user folder with robocopy (this will include the Downloads and Desktop folders)
#   robocopy C:\Users\Boss D:\Backups\Users-$($env:Username)-$(Get-Date -format "yyyy-MM-dd__HH-mm") /mir /r:1 /w:1 /xj
#      # /XJ :: eXclude symbolic links (for both files and directories) and Junction points. 
#      # /XJD :: eXclude symbolic links for Directories and Junction points. 
#      # /XJF :: eXclude symbolic links for Files.

# YouTube: Can't click a video to start/pause it anymore?
# Since yesterday, I have to use the manual play bar to be able to pause/start a video.
